Hello there! 

In order to run this billion dollar software, please have python 3.11 or higher installed.

If you don't already have the following modules please install:

- pip install pandas
- pip install tabulate

And whatever else might be missing! 

Finally, you can run the program with: 

- py main.py (windows)
- python3 main.py (mac maybe? Idk I didnt try, BUT YOU CAN!)

Now just enter a date and an id

AND SEE THE MAGNIFICENT TABLE PRINT TO THE CONSOLE! Wow :) 

Feeling 'testy'? Well, this program doesn't mind getting tested. 

Run tests with: 

- py -m unittest tests.py (on windows)
- python3 -m unittest tests.py (on mac)

ONE MORE THING!

You can open the Assesment.code-workspace file to get a view of all the files in the project in vscode. Highly reccomend before running!

See anything wrong? Not to worry! We'll fix it in prod! (jk...?)
